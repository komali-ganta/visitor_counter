# visitor_counter
This is my Intern project @HMIES,Vskp
The Visitor Counter Project using Arduino and IR sensors automatically counts the number of people entering and exiting a room and displays the live count on an LCD. Two IR sensors placed at the entrance detect movement—one for entry and one for exit—so the system increases or decreases the count accordingly without manual effort. It is simple, low-cost, reliable, and useful in places like classrooms, offices, libraries, malls, hospitals, and smart buildings for monitoring occupancy and saving power through automation.
